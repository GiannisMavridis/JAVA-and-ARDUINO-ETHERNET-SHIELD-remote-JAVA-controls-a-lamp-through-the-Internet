In this project, we want to control a REMOTE lamp(it can be located anywhere in the world) through a JAVA console app.

For example,when we will give the command TURN ON and press ENTER , the remote lamp will turn on !!!

The basic 2 parts of the system we want to build are the following:

-the remote lamp will be connected through a relay to an Arduino Uno board, which will be connected to the Internet via the Arduino 
Ethernet shield.
Instead of a lamp we can control a LED . The idea is the same! 

-the other part is the JAVA application that will send commands to the remote Arduino board.
